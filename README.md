## Features

1. Symbolic Derivation:

+ The application accepts a function as input in the form of a character string.
+ The expression is transformed into postfix notation to facilitate further processing.

2. Binary Tree Representation:

+ The program creates a binary tree associated with the given function expression.
+ This binary tree serves as the foundation for subsequent derivation operations.

3. Derivation Process:

+ The application derives the function symbolically by operating on the binary tree.
+ The derivative tree is generated, and several simplifications are applied to enhance readability.

4. Equation Solving:

5. The program is equipped to solve both first and second-degree equations.
+ Solutions to the equations are presented, offering a comprehensive overview.

6. Graphical Presentation:

+ Utilizing the WinBGIm graphics library, the application provides a graphical representation of the derived function and equation solutions.
